#### About me
Hello everyone, my name is Oleg, and I am trying to overcome the difficult path of an IT specialist. Good. After graduating from school, I entered Polotsk State University, where I got a profession: "Chemical Engineer-technologist", since childhood I dreamed of becoming a programmer, but... As they say, not all at once. After graduating from university, I went to work at an oil refinery. After a month of work, I realized that it was time to take up my dream and pave the way to it. I started with the c# language, in which I wanted to create games on the Unity engine. After a year of study, I could already write hyper-casual games, but due to certain circumstances I had to postpone this idea. I also entered the evening form of study at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radio Engineering. Where I got acquainted with c++, which, by the way, I liked for its logic and consistency. Now I am on the path of a Front-end developer. And yes, this is an extremely interesting direction in the IT sphere. Which I strive to get into and put a lot of effort into it.
